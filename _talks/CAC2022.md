We address the levitation control of the single-point levitation system for maglev train by using the cascade control strategy in this paper. The levitation system is divided into two subsystems, i.e., electromagnetic system and motion system. In order to stabilize the levitation system more faster and roust, we design the sliding mode controller and fuzzy Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller, which constitute the cascade control, to control the electromagnetic system and motion system, respectively. The effectiveness and robustness of the cascade control are also verified in the numerical simulations.
