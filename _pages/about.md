I received a B.S. in Automation and a Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/), Hefei, Anhui, China, in 2010 and 2015, respectively. From June 2015 to June 2017, I was a Lecturer with [School of Computer Science and Control Engineering](http://cst.nuc.edu.cn/), [North University of China](https://www.nuc.edu.cn/). From July 2017 to December 2024, I was a Lecturer with [School of Electrical and Control Engineering](http://ece.nuc.edu.cn/), [North University of China](https://www.nuc.edu.cn/). Since December 2024, I have been an Associate Professor with [School of Electrical and Control Engineering](http://ece.nuc.edu.cn/), [North University of China](https://www.nuc.edu.cn/). I have long been engaged in research on the control of quantum systems and the application of artificial intelligence in the field of new energy, focusing on the preparation of quantum logic gates, the stabilization control of quantum states, and the health management of lithium-ion batteries, and my related research results have been published in Automatica, Energy, Science China Information Sciences, Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, Journal of The Franklin Institute, IFAC World Congress, CCC and other well-known journals and conferences. I have published over 60 SCI/EI papers, of which 32 are first/corresponding authors (including 19 SCI papers), one monograph and have been granted 7 patents. I have presided over two Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province, one Scientific and Technological Innovation Program of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi, and participated in three National Natural Science Foundation of China as a principal researcher. I have served as Session Co-Chair of the Chinese Control Conference (CCC) and Session Chair of the Chinese Process Control Conference (CPCC). I have been a reviewer for top control and energy journals such as Automatica, IEEE SMC, IEEE TCYB, RESS, Applied Energy, Energy, etc (more than 100 times in the last two years), and have served as a TPC member for many workshops of the flagship conferences, such as ICC, GLOBECOM, etc. I am a reviewer of [Mathematical Reviews](https://www.ams.org/mr-database) of the [American Mathematical Society](https://www.ams.org/) (AMS) and a member of the program committee of the TCCT Symposium on Nonlinear Systems and Control.

本人2010年本科毕业于中国科学技术大学自动化专业，2015年博士毕业于中国科学技术大学控制科学与工程专业，目前在中北大学电气与控制工程学院担任副教授。长期从事量子系统控制和人工智能在新能源领域的应用等方面的研究，重点关注量子逻辑门的制备、量子态的镇定控制以及锂离子电池的健康管理，相关研究成果发表于Automatica、Energy、Science China Information Sciences、Chaos, Solitons & Fractals、Journal of The Franklin Institute、IFAC World Congress、CCC等知名期刊及国内外会议。发表SCI/EI论文60余篇，其中第一/通讯作者32篇(包括19篇SCI)，独著出版专著1部，授权专利7项。主持山西省自然科学基金2项、山西省高等学校科技创新项目1项，以主要研究人员参与国家自然科学基金3项。曾担任中国控制会议(CCC)的Session Co-Chair和中国过程控制会议(CPCC)的Session Chair。长期担任Automatica、IEEE SMC、IEEE TCYB、RESS、Applied Energy、Energy等控制领域和能源领域TOP期刊审稿人(近两年审稿次数总计超过100次)，担任ICC、GLOBECOM等国际旗舰会议多个Workshop的TPC member。本人是美国数学学会(American Mathematical Society，AMS)《Mathematical Reviews》的评论员、TCCT非线性系统与控制主题研讨会程序委员会委员。
